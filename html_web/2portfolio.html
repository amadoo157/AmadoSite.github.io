                    <p style="display: flex; font-family:serif; padding-left: 10%;font-size: 16px;">Successfully implemented an external sorting algorithm for binary data using a modified version of Heap Sort. Our project required efficient disk I/O on a random-access file with the use of a buffer pool. We generated a comprehensive report on the statistics of buffer pool performance during the sorting process and achieved an optimal runtime.</p>

                    <p style="display: flex; font-family:serif; padding-left: 10%;font-size: 16px;">Developed a database system that utilizes a skip list and a specific PR Quadtree to store and query collections. Our system can perform spatial queries within a defined area. The spatial queries are executed through recursion, resulting in simplified code, and streamlined performance</p>

                    <p style="display: flex; font-family:serif; padding-left: 10%;font-size: 16px;">Developed a memory management project to efficiently manage data on songs with large memory space. We used a hash function and quadratic probing for collision resolution, ensuring rapid addition and removal of songs as the program utilized a single dedicated memory space.</p>

                    <p style="display: flex; font-family:serif; padding-left: 10%;font-size: 16px;">Developed a concise website that succinctly presents my qualifications as a candidate. The website has undergone several iterations, with improvements made to its CSS and JavaScript components. As of April 2023, I am utilizing React to further enhance the website's reusability and to incorporate a more sophisticated user interface.</p>
